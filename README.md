We demonstrate the operation of Step-to-Charge, a Machine-to-Wearable Resonant Human Body Powering technology using off-the-shelf components to power a wearable form-factor temperature and humidity sensor. The Step-to-Charge setup is demonstrated using an Aluminum foil on the floor acting as the signal plate for the transmitter. A man standing on the Aluminum foil acts as the body channel for power transfer. A commercially available temperature and humidity sensing device is the receiver to demonstrate power transfer. The receiver setup consists of a full wave bridge rectifier using Schottky diodes (1N5819) to rectify the floor-based transmitter's AC power sent through the body. The temperature and humidity sensor is connected to the rectifier. We observe that stepping on the Aluminum foil sheet powers the wearable sensor, thus displaying the ambient temperature and humidity. This demonstration illustrates successful power transfer for a channel length of >1m, allowing whole body powering with EQS Resonant Human Body Powering using Step-to-Charge.
